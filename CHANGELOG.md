# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed
- ChatGPT connector `search` and `fetch` now return their required typed structured outputs while retaining matching JSON text content.
- Backend outages, aggregate write failures, duplicate-merge failures, and attachment JSON errors now produce truthful error or partial statuses instead of successful empty results.
- Signed attachment downloads retain their originating library scope, and attachment idempotency/confirmation records are serialized across processes.
- Every advertised tool now carries explicit read-only, destructive, idempotency, and open-world behavior annotations.
- Inline and MCP-resource attachment delivery have configurable bounded memory limits; large binaries are directed to signed streaming URLs.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added
- Complete attachment discovery, binary download/upload, replacement, metadata, reparenting, and trash/restore interface with signed transfer capabilities.
- Per-call MCP write-administration secret and local-first Zotero 10 write authorization, including remote-local write routing.

### Changed
- Semantic rebuilds are resumable and partitioned by Zotero server/library identity.
- Local and cloud attachment fallback behavior is consistent across document, PDF, and annotation tools.

## [0.7.4] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed
- Retrieval results now protect RSS content and JSON-formatted documents from legacy status/field parsing, while echoed scientific titles cannot accidentally change write outcomes.
- Empty and failed collection listings, unresolved OpenAlex records, and semantic updates with per-item errors now expose truthful empty, error, and partial statuses.
- Connector search omits malformed semantic rows instead of inventing unfetchable IDs, and connector fetch rejects malformed Zotero keys before API access or URL construction.
- Invalid non-finite or overflowing `ZOTERO_MCP_LOCK_TIMEOUT` values fall back to the bounded default instead of raising from the runtime lock primitive.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-08-06

### Changed
- Structured legacy result fields and identifier categories are consistently arrays, including common item, note, attachment, collection, citation, and DOI keys returned by write tools.

### Fixed
- Scientific document text can no longer be misclassified as an empty, blocked, or failed tool result merely because it contains words such as "missing", "failure", or "calibration".
- Direct localhost calls to Zotero's connector and Better BibTeX endpoints now participate in the same cross-process API lock as regular Zotero client operations.
- Connector search and fetch results now expose the same library-aware Zotero citation URL.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-08-06

### Added
- Legacy Markdown-returning MCP tools now expose parsed scalar fields and stable Zotero item, attachment, collection, semantic chunk, DOI, and citation-key identifiers in the structured `data` result without duplicating long prose.

### Fixed
- Tool outcomes distinguish errors, blocked capabilities, empty resolver results, and partial success across all known return paths instead of reporting several negative outcomes as successful.
- Connector citation links follow the active request library, use current Zotero personal/group deep-link formats, and no longer generate a nonexistent web-library URL for local `user:0` libraries.
- Zotero API calls are serialized across MCP and CLI processes as well as threads, with bounded waiting, reentrant nested calls, and automatic kernel cleanup when a process exits.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **Capability-aware MCP profiles** — `serve --tool-profile auto|research|full|admin|connector|all` exposes a coherent surface for the active credentials and optional dependencies. `zotero_get_capabilities` explains the effective contract, while `zotero_get_search_database_health` audits the active library's semantic storage.
- **Stable structured tool results** — Zotero tools retain their complete Markdown response and now also return a common `ok`, `status`, `text`, `warnings`, and `errors` envelope. Tool schemas describe every parameter; connector-standard `search` and `fetch` retain their required protocol shape.

### Changed
- **Safe, deterministic retrieval** — metadata search is exact by default with explicit relaxed/semantic fallback, semantic filters compose correctly, exact item/chunk retrieval is supported, and PDF/full-text attachment choice has deterministic documented precedence with an explicit attachment-key override.
- **Convergent imports by default** — add tools and `zotero-cli add` now default to `if_exists="reuse"`; `merge` and `duplicate` are explicit. Legacy `skip`/`file` aliases remain accepted. Attachment policies are consistently `auto|none|linked_url|required`, and unsatisfied required attachments report retained metadata as a partial result.
- **Grounded research guidance** — prompts direct models from semantic discovery to exact chunk verification before quotation or detailed claims, reserve whole-fulltext retrieval for document-wide reading, and require confirmation before library writes.
- **Fresh semantic indexes use passage chunking by default** with a 6,000-character target, 750-character overlap, and a 768-chunk item cap. Existing explicitly configured indexes are not silently rebuilt.
- **Semantic retrieval tools now advertise a three-tier reading workflow:** use semantic search for discovery, exact semantic context for targeted evidence, and full-text retrieval only for whole-document analysis. The descriptions include practical follow-up rules, stale-hash guidance, and token-cost safeguards so MCP clients can choose the appropriate tool reliably.

### Fixed
- Library switching now scopes semantic collections, update state, and local SQLite reads to the active Zotero library; all Zotero client calls share bounded serialization so reads and writes cannot race a prune/update phase.
- Removed-item pruning, immediate metadata refresh, staged vector replacement, semantic health checks, and status accounting now agree across incremental and rebuild pathways.
- Child attachment reporting, collection filtering, relation rollback, synthesis grouping, and PDF page/outline selection no longer produce ambiguous or cross-item results.
- Synchronous tools no longer leak un-awaited FastMCP logging coroutines or risk deadlocking execution on progress messages.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **Exact semantic-context retrieval** — semantic search results now expose the stored Chroma chunk ID and content hash. The new `zotero_get_semantic_context` tool returns that exact indexed passage, optionally with up to two neighboring chunks on each side, and can reject stale search references by hash without re-extracting attachments or generating embeddings.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **Opt-in collection filter for the semantic search database** — set `semantic_search.collection_keys` in `config.json` to build the vector database from only those collections (subcollections included, resolved recursively) instead of the whole library. Unset, behavior is unchanged (#370).

### Fixed
- **Chunking no longer forces a full re-extract and re-embed of the whole library on every update.** With `semantic_search.chunking` enabled (#350), items are indexed only under their chunk ids (`<key>#<n>`), but the "already indexed?" check in the local-fulltext path looked each item up by its bare key. That exact-id lookup never matched, so every item counted as new: each fulltext update re-extracted every PDF and re-embedded the entire library, silently and without an error. `get_document_metadata` now falls back to chunk 0, which carries the item-level `date_modified` and `has_fulltext` that the check needs, so unchanged items are skipped again (#380).
- **Local database auto-discovery now honors a custom Zotero data directory** — the `extensions.zotero.dataDir` preference is read from the Zotero profile's `prefs.js` (macOS/Windows/Linux), so relocated data directories no longer fail with "Zotero database not found at ~/Zotero/zotero.sqlite" (#68). The `ZOTERO_DB_PATH` environment variable, documented in the README but previously unimplemented, now works as an override, and the not-found error lists every location checked plus how to fix it. `extensions.zotero.baseAttachmentPath` is likewise read from the profile's `prefs.js`, fixing resolution of linked attachments relative to a base directory (#379).
- **Items whose full-text extraction once failed are retried when their attachments change** — attaching a PDF later doesn't bump the parent's `dateModified`, so items first indexed metadata-only were permanently locked out of full-text indexing. The local-mode scan now records each item's attachment-key set and retries when it changes; legacy "failed" records retry once and converge (#373).
- **ChromaDB upserts are split to the backend's max batch size** — with chunking enabled, a batch of long documents could exceed ChromaDB's `max_batch_size` (~5,461), failing the whole batch and degrading the retry pass to one-record-at-a-time upserts (#369).
- **Created annotations land in the right place on PDFs with a non-zero page box origin** — highlight rectangles were written in PyMuPDF's CropBox-normalized space, but Zotero positions annotations in native PDF user space (MediaBox origin). Rects (and the derived sort index) are now mapped through the page's inverse transformation matrix, which also handles page rotation (#381).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **`zotero_get_search_database_status` no longer reports "0 documents / not initialized" against a populated database** — ChromaDB ≥1.x's embedding-function conflict check rejected the status reader's no-op embedding function; it now identifies as `"default"`, which short-circuits the check for any persisted backend (#362, #364).
- **Semantic search with the reranker enabled no longer times out** — the cross-encoder was reloaded from disk on every request (~30s per call); it is now cached process-wide and warmed up in the background at server start, so reranked searches are sub-second after the first load (#283, #365).
- **Ollama embeddings now use the current `/api/embed` endpoint** instead of the deprecated `/api/embeddings` route. The whole batch is sent in a single request (`input`) rather than one request per document, and the response's `embeddings` list is parsed accordingly (#349, #360).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Passage-level chunking for semantic search** (opt-in via `semantic_search.chunking`) — each item is indexed as overlapping passages with char/page provenance, so search returns a grounded snippet and long PDFs stay searchable past the single-vector truncation limit. Off by default; enabling it needs a one-time `update-db --force-rebuild` (#350).
- **Agentic research tools** (#350):
  - `zotero_find_related_papers` — walks the OpenAlex citation graph (references + citing works) and flags each result as already-in-library or a gap.
  - `zotero_library_coverage` — audits which items lack a PDF, with DOIs ready for the OA download cascade.
  - `zotero_synthesize_annotations` — per-paper digest of highlights and notes.
  - `zotero_export_bibliography` — CSL-rendered bibliography / citations / BibTeX via Zotero's own engine.
- **MCP prompts and resources** — `literature_review`, `synthesize_my_notes`, `find_contradicting_evidence`, `expand_from_paper`; resources `zotero://collections`, `zotero://items/{key}`, `zotero://collections/{key}/items` (#350).
- **`zotero_batch_update_extra`** — batch upsert/remove of `Key: value` lines in the Extra field across many items (#232, #334).
- **Collection resolution in all add paths** — collection specs (key, name, or parent/child path) are resolved and validated across every add path and `manage_collections`; an unknown or ambiguous spec fails the add early with suggestions instead of leaving an unfiled item (#336, #340).
- **Idempotent adds** — `if_exists=duplicate|file|skip`: re-adding converges (files into missing collections, adds missing tags) instead of duplicating. MCP default stays `duplicate`; the CLI defaults to `file` (#337, #341).
- **`zotero-cli add isbn|bibtex|csl-json` subcommands**, with stdin via `-` (#338, #342).
- **Ollama embedding backend** for semantic search (`nomic-embed-text`, `bge-m3`) (#349).
- **OpenAI Batch API embedding indexing** — submit / status / import async embedding jobs for cheaper large-library indexing (#346).
- **OpenAI embedding sub-batching and rate limiting** — `embedding_config.request_batch_size` (default 64, for stricter OpenAI-compatible providers) and an optional `embedding_config.rate_limit_rps` per-request throttle for 429 safety (#261, #307, #356).
- **`citation_key` on `zotero_update_item`** — writes the native `citationKey` field (#320, #321).
- **`ZOTERO_WEBDAV_TIMEOUT`** env var to tune the WebDAV upload read timeout (#344, #345).
- Standalone PDF attachments now surface in `zotero_get_collection_items` (#224).

### Fixed
- Incremental semantic sync no longer advances the watermark when the immutable sqlite snapshot lags the live API (un-checkpointed WAL), which previously made newly-added items be skipped permanently (#292, #333).
- `update-db --fulltext` no longer caps each item at a single truncated vector; passage chunking indexes full text past the embedding limit (#290).
- `zotero-cli add file` no longer raises `TypeError` from a phantom `parent_key`; exposes `--title` / `--item-type` (#335, #339).
- `zotero_read_pdf_pages` routes through the shared multi-source download (local → WebDAV → cloud), so WebDAV-backed PDFs work (#351).
- Scite reaches the `/papers` endpoint correctly — it now sends a bare JSON array instead of a `{"dois": [...]}` object (which returned HTTP 400 and broke retraction checks), and matches Scite's lowercased DOI keys so uppercase DOIs (e.g. `10.1016/S0140-6736(97)11096-0`) aren't missed (#331).
- Semantic search reliability: deterministic embeddings via explicit `encoding_format="float"` (fixes intermittent OpenRouter/Gemini "No embedding data received"); `db-status` no longer loads an embedding model or holds the global API lock (#348).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **`zotero_get_page_layout` tool** — detect figure/table regions on a PDF page with bounding boxes and caption association, for coordinate-grounded reading (#312).
- **`zotero_add_by_bibtex`** — ingest one or more items from a BibTeX string OR a `.bib`/`.bibtex` file path; parses via `bibtexparser` (with LaTeX→unicode conversion), maps to Zotero item format, preserves the citation key in Extra, and attempts an open-access PDF attachment when a DOI is present (#241).
- **`zotero_add_by_csl_json`** — same for CSL JSON input from an inline string/object/array OR a `.json`/`.csljson` file path. The CSL `id` is preserved in Extra as the citation key (#241).
- New `citation_import` module — BibTeX parsing, CSL JSON coercion, and the shared field/type crosswalk (reference: <https://aurimasv.github.io/z2csl/typeMap.xml>).
- **`zotero_read_pdf_pages` tool** — read a specific page range from a PDF attachment after section identification via `zotero_get_pdf_outline`. Extracts text from the requested pages using PyMuPDF, avoiding the need to read the entire paper when only a few pages are relevant.
- RSS feed items now surface their publication date (and DOI) (#316).

### Changed
- Bumped the `pyzotero` floor to `>=1.8.0` — the first release accepting the custom HTTP/1.1 `client=` used by the local-API fix; older `1.6.x`/`1.7.x` crashed every tool call with `TypeError: unexpected keyword argument 'client'` (#322).
- Bumped the `[semantic]` extra's `chromadb` floor to `>=1.0.0` for `register_embedding_function`, introduced in chromadb 1.0.0 (#324).
- New base dependency: `bibtexparser>=1.4,<2`.

### Fixed
- `zotero_search_by_citation_key` now matches the native `citationKey` field, not just the `Extra` fallback (#319).
- Custom OpenAI/Gemini/HuggingFace embedding functions are registered with ChromaDB's registry so a persisted database reloads correctly (#315).
- Bounded the global Zotero API lock so a stuck operation can't wedge every tool with opaque `-32001` timeouts (#311).
- `zotero_add_by_url` arXiv path is resilient to arXiv outages via a CrossRef fallback (#310).
- `zotero_add_by_doi` and arXiv PDF uploads now honor `ZOTERO_WEBDAV_*` instead of always going to Zotero cloud storage (#314, #313).
- Strip the pyzotero-rejected `lastRead` field on attachment updates, fixing `zotero_update_item` failures on attachments opened in Zotero's PDF reader (#318, #317).

### Security
- **SSRF guard on the open-access PDF download path** — the OA-PDF URL comes from third-party metadata APIs (Unpaywall / Semantic Scholar) and was previously fetched with no scheme/host validation and default redirect-following. It is now validated against a public-host allowlist (rejecting loopback / link-local / RFC1918 / cloud-metadata) with per-redirect-hop re-checking (#327, #326).
- **Credential-hygiene + DoS hardening**: mask `ZOTERO_API_KEY` in `setup --no-claude` output by default (`--show-secrets` to opt in); write credential config files with `0o600`; prefer the env var / `getpass` over the `--api-key` flag; add a subprocess timeout to `pdfannots2json`; run the Docker image as a non-root user (#328, #326).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Scite citation intelligence integration** — the MCP counterpart of the [Scite Zotero Plugin](https://github.com/scitedotai/scite-zotero-plugin). New optional `[scite]` extra that enriches Zotero library items with citation data from [scite.ai](https://scite.ai). No Scite account required (#180).
  - `scite_enrich_item`: Get citation tallies (supporting/contrasting/mentioning) and editorial notice alerts for any paper by DOI or Zotero item key.
  - `scite_enrich_search`: Search your Zotero library and see Scite tallies and retraction alerts inline with each result.
  - `scite_check_retractions`: Scan your library (by collection, tag, or recent items) for retractions, corrections, and other editorial notices.
- New `scite_client.py` module: thin HTTP client for `api.scite.ai` public endpoints (tallies, paper metadata, editorial notices).

### Fixed
- **macOS PDF extraction deadlock** — replaced `multiprocessing.Process` with `subprocess.run` to prevent FastMCP re-initialization in child process (#178, #173, #181).
- **Deleted items indexed in semantic search** — excluded trashed items from `get_items_with_text()` and `get_item_count()` (#175).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-22

### Fixed
- **`create_annotation` crash** — fixed `_client._client.` double-indirection typo introduced in v0.2.0 refactor (#168).
- **`attachments:` path resolution** — now reads `baseAttachmentPath` from Zotero's `prefs.js` instead of wrongly resolving against the storage directory (#169).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-22

### Architecture
- **Split `server.py` (4,800 lines) into `tools/` subpackage** — search, retrieval, annotations, write, connectors, and shared helpers are now separate modules. `server.py` is a 109-line re-export shim.
- **Removed `_ServerModule` sys.modules hack** — tool modules use module-level attribute access; tests patch canonical locations directly.
- **Optional dependency groups** — `[semantic]` (ChromaDB, embeddings), `[pdf]` (PyMuPDF, EPUB), `[all]`. Base install is lightweight with no ML dependencies.

### Refactored
- Deduplicated 7 item-formatting functions into single `format_item_result()` with configurable abstract length, tags, and extra fields.
- Extracted `_normalize_limit()` helper replacing 12 copy-pasted `isinstance(limit, str)` blocks.
- Consolidated duplicate `suppress_stdout()` into `utils.py`.
- Merged `_strip_xml_tags()` into `clean_html()` with `collapse_whitespace` parameter.
- Extended `format_creators()` to handle string creators; `_format_bbt_result()` now delegates to it.
- Collapsed `get_annotations`/`_get_annotations` wrapper into single function.
- Modernized typing in 5 modules: `Optional[X]` → `X | None`, `Dict` → `dict`, `List` → `list`.
- Removed dead code: unused `_extract_item_key_from_input()` function, stale typing imports across 7 modules.

### Fixed
- **Stale embedding model detection** — ChromaDB collections created with a deprecated model (e.g., `text-embedding-004`) are now auto-detected and recreated on startup.
- **Bare `except:` clauses** — replaced with specific exception types in `better_bibtex_client.py`.
- **PDF outline import order** — defers PyMuPDF import until after attachment check.
- **Suppressed noisy pdfminer warnings** during PDF text extraction.

### Docs
- README documents optional extras (`[semantic]`, `[pdf]`, `[all]`), write operations, and embedding model troubleshooting.
- Removed stale fork enhancements section.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **Write operations** — 10+ new tools: `create_item`, `update_item`, `create_note`, `add_tags`, `batch_update_tags`, `create_collection`, `add_to_collection`, `remove_from_collection`, `add_by_doi`, `add_by_url`, `add_from_file` (PR #165).
- **BetterBibTeX citation key lookup** — `search_by_citation_key` searches both BetterBibTeX JSON-RPC and the Extra field (#72).
- **PDF outline extraction** — `get_pdf_outline` returns table of contents from PDFs.
- **Annotation page labels** — `get_annotations` now includes `annotationPageLabel` and `annotationPosition` data (#159).
- **PDF timeout** — configurable `pdf_timeout` (default 30s) skips slow PDFs during fulltext extraction (#74).
- **Semantic search quality** — combined field+fulltext embeddings, Gemini `retrieval_query`/`retrieval_document` fix, model-aware tokenizer, optional cross-encoder re-ranking (PR #154).
- **Abstracts in collection items** — `get_collection_items` now includes abstracts (#143).
- **Local-first fulltext extraction** — prefers local DB/storage before remote `dump()` for file-backed attachments (PR #166).
- **`--fulltext` guard** — aborts with clear error when used without `ZOTERO_LOCAL` enabled (PR #156).

### Fixed
- **search_notes** — fixed `qmode` and client-side filter to actually find notes (#137).
- **batch_update_tags** — fixed stale tag set, response type check, and added hybrid local+web mode (#162).
- **get_tags pagination** — uses `zot.everything()` for reliable tag retrieval (#70).
- **Fulltext truncation** — removed hardcoded 10k/5k char caps; model-aware truncation via `embedding_max_tokens` (#153, #134).
- **Local mode file:// paths** — resolves `file://`, absolute paths, and `attachments:` prefixes (#116).
- **Child notes** — `create_note` properly attaches as child via web API in local mode (#133).
- **ChromaDB embedding conflict** — auto-detects and resets collection on model change (#109).
- **FastMCP compatibility** — removed deprecated `dependencies` parameter (#117, #61).
- **PDF outline import order** — defers PyMuPDF import until after attachment check.
- **Update interval display** — fixed misleading display for daily schedule (PR #144).
- **Config loading** — embedding model config now loads correctly from config file (#76).

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-09
